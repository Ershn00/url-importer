## Description
*Symfony application that allows users to import URLs from a CSV file. The application consist of just one form to select the CSV file. The URLs are inserted into a MySQL table.
Before inserting the URLs, check if they are already in the table so we donâ€™t insert duplicates. After the form is submitted inform the user how many URLs have been added to the table.*

## Constraints
- "Filter" folder includes "DuplicateFilter" class that checks 
if the URL is included in the table. Any filter to be identified as a
class can be included in the "FilterChain" class that loops all filters defined.
